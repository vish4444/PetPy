Brief Intro:
I am a Software Testing Professional with over 8 years of experience in Manual/Automation Testing ; presently leading a team of developers and test engineers for a BI/DW project. I am well versed with SQL and beginners level scripting knowledge of Python. Having spent considerable amount of time finding faults I have developed an immense interest in correcting those myself in a better way but feel less equipped at times and hence want to learn full fledged programming. I have couple of projects in my mind and couple of professional aspirations which is why I want to become a full stack developer.

Questions:  
Will I learn any programming language in particular Python, C++, etc?

Will there be a single mentor? I feel this way she/he will know my level of understanding, grasping and can put in additional efforts say to explain concepts that I may be weak in, say OOPS :).

Do you give a certificate of completion?

What about the daily timings, say if I am stuck somewhere in my project and working hard to figure it out, can i stay back? Reason for asking is, as a professional I believe in aiming for the best and not in clocking 8 hrs per day, so I am fine staying back to achieve the best and clear my understanding.

Will i be allowed to work at the facility over the weekends, want to make the best use of time in these 12 weeks?
