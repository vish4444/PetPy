Code hacks in Python:
'''Code to display methods of an object in python''''
print ([method for method in dir(comments) if callable(getattr(comments, method))])

'''How python knows where to search when you try to import a module?''''
import sys
sys.path

#sys is a built in module, its written in C and hence its source code is not avail.

#you can change or update a path at runtime
sys.path.append ('C:\\Dev\\TechnicalOperations\\Libraries\\NaviNetSyslogLibs')

''''How to call a program or import another program file as a module''''
import odbchelper 
# here you are importing a program you created as a module, for some specific use in another pgm.

params (server name, DB, UID, PW)

# here you can access any public functions in that module by including the module name
print odbchelper.BuildConnectionString (params)

#here you are accessing an attribute of the BuildConnectionString func
print odbchelper.BuildConnectionString.__doc__
